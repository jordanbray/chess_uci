Traits to implement a chess UCI engine

This project is a work in progress.  I wouldn't use it yet.

It contains traits to implement a search, evaluation function, time manager, and an engine structure which is generic over those
traits.

It also contains some default implementations (bad at chess, but well tested) for the above, to reduce overhead to get started.

It also contains structures to allow you to talk to a UCI compatible engine, if for example you are making a GUI.
